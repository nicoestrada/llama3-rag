# Local Llama3 - RAG Implementation

This application uses Streamlit's built-in features to create a simple web application that allows users to enter a webpage URL and ask questions about the content. Here's how it works:

## Input
* Enter a webpage URL into the text input field
* Ask any question about the webpage in the subsequent text input field

## Processing

**What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?**

RAG is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to generate text that is relevant to a given prompt or question. It combines the strengths of two approaches:

1. **Retrieval**: This involves finding relevant text snippets from a large corpus of text data, such as a database of articles or documents.
2. **Generation**: This involves generating new text based on the retrieved snippets and the input prompt.

**How does RAG work with a URL link?**

Let's say you enter the URL `https://www.example.com/article1` into the application. Here's how RAG might work:

1. **Retrieval**: The application loads the webpage content from the URL using the `WebBaseLoader` class.
2. **Text Extraction**: The loaded content is extracted and broken down into smaller text snippets, such as sentences or paragraphs.
3. **Relevance Scoring**: Each text snippet is analyzed to determine its relevance to the input prompt or question. This might involve comparing the text snippet's content to the prompt using techniques like keyword matching or semantic similarity measures.
4. **Ranking**: The relevant text snippets are ranked based on their relevance scores, with the most relevant snippets appearing at the top of the list.
5. **Generation**: The application uses a language model (e.g., a transformer-based architecture) to generate new text that is informed by the retrieved and ranked text snippets. This generated text aims to be coherent and relevant to the input prompt.

**Example Output**

Suppose you enter the question "What is the main idea of this article?" into the application, along with the URL
`https://www.example.com/article1`. The RAG algorithm might retrieve the following relevant text snippets:

* "The article discusses the impact of climate change on global food production."
* "Researchers have warned that rising temperatures will lead to devastating consequences for agriculture."
* "To mitigate these effects, experts recommend implementing sustainable agricultural practices."

The ranked list of snippets would likely include the first two sentences as most relevant. The generated text might be something like:

"The article highlights the pressing issue of climate change's impact on global food production, with experts warning of devastating consequences for agriculture if sustainable practices are not implemented."

In this example, RAG combines retrieval and generation to produce a response that is informed by the original webpage content and relevant to the input question.

## Output
* The application displays the extracted text from the webpage in response to user input, providing a simple way to view the contents of a webpage or the knowledge needed to answer user prompts.

Note: This application requires a local installation of Llama3-8b to be on your machine.
